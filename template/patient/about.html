<h2 class="text-center">About Us</h2>

<p>
    My Consultant is an online consultation platform where patients can register into the system 
    and provide their symptoms to receive a preliminary disease prediction from an automated 
    bot. This feature helps patients gain an initial understanding of their health condition. If the 
    patient is satisfied with the automated diagnosis, they can proceed without further action. 
    However, if they require additional consultation, they can book an appointment with a 
    registered doctor through the platform.
    The system is designed to enhance the feasibility and accessibility of healthcare services, 
    especially in the context of increased demand for online solutions due to the pandemic. 
    Online consultations significantly reduce the overall cost and complexity of the process, 
    encouraging users to seek medical help conveniently as per their needs.
    The platform incorporates an Online Registration System that links various hospitals across 
    the country. This system facilitates user-based online registration and appointment 
    scheduling. Counter-based OPD registrations and appointment bookings through the Hospital 
    Management Information System have been fully digitalized. The portal enables patients to 
    book appointments with various departments of hospital using their login credentials.
    For new patients, the system generates a Unique Registration Number along with an 
    appointment number. If a patient is already registered with our software, they will receive an 
    appointment number, while their existing registration details remain unchanged.
    Additionally, the platform allows doctors to upload prescriptions and recommend lab tests. 
    Patients can access their lab reports and prescriptions directly through the system, ensuring 
    seamless and comprehensive care management. This integration of services makes the 
    process more efficient and user-friendly, meeting the evolving needs of modern healthcare 
    delivery.
    My Consultant" integrates machine learning algorithms to provide an automated preliminary 
    disease prediction system, enhancing the accessibility and affordability of healthcare services. 
    By leveraging patient-reported symptoms, the system analyzes data to generate an initial 
    diagnosis, helping users understand their health condition. The ML model continuously 
    improves through feedback, refining its predictions over time. If patients require further 
    consultation, they can seamlessly book appointments with registered doctors. This integration 
    of AI-driven diagnostics with a comprehensive healthcare management system allows for 
    better resource allocation, faster diagnosis, and an improved overall patient experience. The 
    platform's robust backend, including automated registration, appointment scheduling, and 
    prescription management, further simplifies healthcare processes while ensuring data 
    accuracy and privacy
